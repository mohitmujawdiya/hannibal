The plan must be comprehensive and detailed — a team should be able to start work from it. Include all sections that apply, skip or add sections as the context demands.\n\n--- IMPLEMENTATION / PRODUCT PLAN (default for feature builds, product launches, or when type is unclear) ---\n\n**Problem Statement** — At least 3-4 sentences. Lead with user pain, not business opportunity. Quantify the cost of the status quo (time wasted, money lost, opportunities missed). Name who feels this pain most acutely.\n\n**Target Users** — At least 2-3 distinct user segments. Define by behavior, context, and need — not demographics. Each segment should imply different product decisions.\n\n**Proposed Solution** — At least 2-3 paragraphs. Start with the core insight (why THIS approach), then walk through user flows not feature lists. Show how it resolves the pain from the problem statement.\n\n**Technical Approach** — At least 3-4 key technical decisions. Identify the hardest technical problems. Call out what to prototype first. Note build-vs-buy decisions and key technology choices with rationale.\n\n**Success Metrics** — At least 4-5 metrics. Each needs: current baseline (or 'unknown — measure in week 1'), target value, and timeframe. No vanity metrics — every metric should inform a go/no-go decision.\n\n**Risks** — At least 3-4 risks spanning market, technical, and execution. Each needs: likelihood (high/medium/low), impact (high/medium/low), and a concrete mitigation (not 'monitor closely').\n\n**Timeline** — At least 3 phases with milestones. Each phase has a validation gate — what must be true to proceed. Show dependencies between phases. Include what can be parallelized.\n\n--- GO-TO-MARKET PLAN (for launches, market entry, positioning, or channel strategy) ---\n\n**Market Opportunity** — Size the opportunity with TAM/SAM/SOM or equivalent. Ground in real data — cite sources or flag assumptions needing validation.\n\n**Target Segments** — At least 2-3 segments defined by buying behavior, urgency, and willingness to pay — not demographics. Rank by attractiveness and explain sequencing.\n\n**Positioning & Messaging** — Core value proposition per segment. How you win against the current alternative. Include a positioning statement and key proof points.\n\n**Channel Strategy** — At least 3 channels with rationale. For each: expected CAC, time-to-results, and what 'working' looks like. Distinguish awareness vs. acquisition vs. activation channels.\n\n**Launch Sequence** — Phased plan: pre-launch, launch, post-launch. Each phase has specific activities, owners, and success criteria. Include what triggers moving to the next phase.\n\n**Pricing & Packaging** — Pricing model, tiers, and what the structure signals strategically. Justify with competitive benchmarks or willingness-to-pay data.\n\n**Success Metrics** — At least 4-5 metrics. Include leading indicators (week 1-2) and lagging indicators (month 2-3). Each needs baseline, target, and measurement method.\n\n**Budget & Resources** — Key cost categories, team requirements, and timeline for spend. Flag the biggest cost uncertainties.\n\n--- TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE PLAN (for system design, platform work, or infrastructure decisions) ---\n\n**System Context** — What this system does, who/what interacts with it, and where it sits in the broader architecture. Include a high-level component description.\n\n**Architecture Decisions** — At least 3-4 key decisions in ADR-style: context, decision, consequences, alternatives considered. Focus on decisions that are hard to reverse.\n\n**Component Design** — Key components with responsibilities, interfaces, and data flow between them. Enough detail to review, not to implement.\n\n**Data Model** — Core entities, relationships, and access patterns. Call out denormalization decisions and consistency requirements.\n\n**Integration Points** — External systems, APIs, and protocols. For each: contract expectations, failure modes, and fallback behavior.\n\n**Scalability & Performance** — Target load (requests/sec, data volume, concurrent users). Identify bottlenecks and scaling strategy (horizontal, vertical, caching, partitioning).\n\n**Migration Path** — How to get from current state to target state without breaking things. Include rollback plan and feature flags needed.\n\n**Technical Risks** — At least 3-4 risks. Focus on unknowns, dependencies on external systems, and performance cliffs. Each needs mitigation and spike/prototype recommendations.\n\n--- GROWTH STRATEGY PLAN (for scaling, retention, experimentation, or unit economics optimization) ---\n\n**Current State & Baseline** — Key metrics today: active users, retention curves, conversion rates, revenue. Be specific — growth plans without baselines are fiction.\n\n**Growth Levers** — Identify the 2-3 highest-leverage opportunities. For each: estimated impact, confidence level, and effort. Use the ICE or RICE framework.\n\n**Acquisition Channels** — At least 3 channels with current performance and improvement hypothesis. Include organic/paid split and channel-specific CAC.\n\n**Activation & Retention** — Define the 'aha moment' and current funnel metrics. Identify the biggest drop-off points and hypotheses for improving them.\n\n**Experimentation Roadmap** — At least 4-5 experiments prioritized by impact and speed. Each needs: hypothesis, metric, minimum sample size, and expected duration.\n\n**Unit Economics** — LTV, CAC, payback period, and gross margin. Show how each growth lever affects these. Flag where the model breaks.\n\n**Success Metrics** — North star metric plus 3-4 supporting metrics. Include weekly/monthly cadence for review and thresholds that trigger strategy pivots.\n\n--- MASTER / STRATEGIC PLAN (for high-level plans coordinating multiple workstreams, portfolio planning, or multi-quarter strategy) ---\n\n**Vision & Strategic Objectives** — Where the product/company is headed and the 3-5 measurable objectives that define success. Each objective needs a timeframe and owner.\n\n**Workstreams & Ownership** — Each major workstream with scope, lead, key milestones, and how it contributes to the strategic objectives. Show what's parallel vs. sequential.\n\n**Cross-Workstream Dependencies** — Map the critical handoffs between workstreams. For each dependency: what's exchanged, when it's needed, and what happens if it slips.\n\n**Resource Allocation** — How headcount, budget, and attention are distributed across workstreams. Call out tradeoffs explicitly — resourcing one area means under-resourcing another.\n\n**Decision Framework** — How the team will make go/no-go decisions at gates. Define escalation paths, decision-makers, and what data is required.\n\n**Key Milestones & Gates** — Portfolio-level milestones with validation criteria. At each gate: what must be true to continue, pivot, or kill.\n\n**Success Metrics** — Portfolio-level metrics that measure overall strategic progress, not just individual workstream outputs.\n\n--- FUNDRAISING / PITCH PLAN (for fundraising strategy, investor outreach, or pitch preparation) ---\n\n**Opportunity & Vision** — The big market shift or insight that makes NOW the right time. Size the opportunity and explain why this team is uniquely positioned. Investors fund timing and teams, not just ideas.\n\n**Traction & Proof Points** — Current metrics, milestones achieved, and evidence of product-market fit. Be specific — revenue, growth rate, retention, LOIs, waitlist size. If pre-revenue, show leading indicators.\n\n**Business Model** — How the company makes money, unit economics (current or projected), and path to profitability. Include revenue model, pricing, and gross margin assumptions.\n\n**Use of Funds** — How the raise will be allocated across hiring, product, GTM, and operations. Tie each allocation to a specific milestone it unlocks. Show the 18-month plan.\n\n**Target Investors** — Investor profiles by stage, sector focus, and check size. Prioritize by strategic value (introductions, domain expertise, follow-on capacity), not just capital.\n\n**Outreach Strategy** — Sequencing: warm intros → targeted cold outreach → broader funnel. Include timeline, who leads each conversation, and how to create competitive dynamics.\n\n**Key Risks & Objections** — The 3-4 questions investors WILL ask and how to answer them. For each: the concern, your counter-narrative, and the evidence that supports it.\n\n**Milestones to Close** — What must be true to close the round. Include: deck ready, data room complete, lead investor identified, term sheet target date, and close date.\n\n--- UNIVERSAL QUALITY CRITERIA (apply to ALL plan types) ---\nEvery section must be specific — no vague placeholders like 'TBD' or 'as needed'. If you lack specifics, call out what needs validation. Quantify wherever possible. Every metric needs a baseline, target, and timeframe. Every risk needs a concrete mitigation, not 'monitor closely'.",

The document must be comprehensive enough that an engineering team could start building from it. Include all sections that apply, skip or add sections as the context demands.\n\n--- PRODUCT PRD (default for feature requirements, product specs, or when type is unclear) ---\n\n**Overview** — Two paragraphs max. First paragraph: the problem and who has it. Second paragraph: how the solution works at a high level. No mission statements.\n\n**User Stories** — At least 5-8 user stories. Format: 'As a [specific role], I want [concrete action] so that [measurable outcome]'. Every story must pass the 'so what' test — if the outcome doesn't matter to the user, rewrite it. Group by user flow, not by component.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria** — At least 3-5 criteria per user story. Given/When/Then or checkbox format. Every criterion must be binary pass/fail — no subjective language ('should feel fast'). Cover: happy path, error states, edge cases, and performance requirements.\n\n**Technical Constraints** — At least 3-4 constraints. Only constraints that affect product decisions (not implementation details). Include: platform requirements, performance budgets, data privacy/compliance, integration requirements, backwards compatibility.\n\n**Out of Scope** — At least 3-4 items. Name the temptations — features the team will want to add but shouldn't. For each, briefly explain why it's deferred (not enough data, dependency not ready, v2 candidate).\n\n**Success Metrics** — At least 4-5 metrics tied directly to user stories. Include at least one metric checkable in the first week after launch. Format: metric name, current baseline, target, measurement method.\n\n**Dependencies** — At least 2-3 dependencies. Upstream teams, APIs, design assets, legal/compliance approvals. Each with: owner, current status, and what's blocked if it slips.\n\n--- TECHNICAL SPEC / API SPEC (for API design, system internals, or engineering-facing specs) ---\n\n**Overview** — What this system/API does, who consumes it, and why it's being built now. Include the key technical decision that frames the rest of the spec.\n\n**System Architecture** — High-level components, their responsibilities, and how they interact. Include data flow direction and sync/async boundaries.\n\n**API Contracts** — Endpoints or interfaces with request/response schemas, status codes, and error formats. Use concrete examples, not abstract descriptions. Specify versioning strategy.\n\n**Data Models** — Core entities with fields, types, constraints, and relationships. Include indexes, access patterns, and migration needs from existing schemas.\n\n**Error Handling** — Error taxonomy with codes, messages, and client recovery actions. Cover: validation errors, auth errors, rate limits, upstream failures, and partial failures.\n\n**Performance Requirements** — Latency targets (p50, p95, p99), throughput expectations, and payload size limits. Include load testing criteria and what 'fast enough' means.\n\n**Security Considerations** — Authentication/authorization model, data encryption (at rest and in transit), input validation, rate limiting, and audit logging requirements.\n\n**Migration & Rollback** — How to deploy without breaking existing consumers. Include backwards compatibility guarantees, feature flags, and rollback procedure.\n\n--- DESIGN SPEC (for UX/UI specifications, interaction design, or user flow documentation) ---\n\n**Overview** — The user problem being solved and the design principle guiding the solution. Keep it grounded — reference specific user research or behavior data.\n\n**User Flows** — At least 2-3 primary flows. Step-by-step with decision points, branching paths, and where the user enters/exits. Include the 'sad path' — what happens when things go wrong.\n\n**Wireframe Descriptions** — Screen-by-screen layout descriptions with content hierarchy, interactive elements, and state variations (empty, loading, error, populated). Detailed enough to hand to a designer.\n\n**Interaction Patterns** — Transitions, animations, micro-interactions, and feedback patterns. Specify trigger, behavior, and duration. Reference existing design system patterns where applicable.\n\n**Accessibility Requirements** — WCAG level target, keyboard navigation flows, screen reader behavior, color contrast requirements, and focus management rules.\n\n**Edge Cases & Error States** — At least 4-5 edge cases. For each: what triggers it, what the user sees, and how they recover. Cover: empty states, permission errors, offline, long content, and rapid actions.\n\n**Design Tokens & Component Mapping** — Map each UI element to existing design system components. Call out new components needed and their specifications.\n\n--- PLATFORM / INFRASTRUCTURE PRD (for infrastructure, DevOps, platform capabilities, or internal tooling) ---\n\n**Overview** — What capability is being built, who the internal customers are, and what they can't do today without it.\n\n**System Requirements** — Functional requirements for the platform capability. Written as 'The system must...' statements, each testable and unambiguous.\n\n**SLAs & Performance Budgets** — Availability target (e.g. 99.9%), latency budgets, throughput guarantees, and data durability requirements. Include how SLAs are measured and reported.\n\n**Integration Points** — Upstream and downstream systems, protocols, authentication methods, and data contracts. For each: what breaks if this integration fails.\n\n**Monitoring & Observability** — Key metrics to instrument, alerting thresholds, dashboard requirements, and log/trace correlation strategy. Define what 'healthy' and 'degraded' look like.\n\n**Rollout Strategy** — Phased rollout plan: canary → limited GA → full GA. Include traffic percentages, bake times, and promotion criteria at each stage.\n\n**Rollback Plan** — How to revert if things go wrong. Include: automated rollback triggers, manual rollback procedure, data recovery steps, and communication plan.\n\n--- UNIVERSAL QUALITY CRITERIA (apply to ALL spec types) ---\nEvery requirement must be specific enough that two engineers would independently build the same thing. No subjective language ('should feel fast', 'user-friendly'). Every criterion must be binary pass/fail. Quantify wherever possible.",
